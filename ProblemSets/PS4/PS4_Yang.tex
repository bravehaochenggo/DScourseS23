\section{Web scraping}

I am interested in the scraping the following websites.


\subsection{Yahoo Finance}

Yahoo Finance provides specific financial data for normal users. I want to learn how to scrap data from Yahoo Finance.

\subsection{SEC Edgar}

This is also a source of a company's financial information. I want to know how do we use web scraping to do text analysis on information extracted from Edgar.
